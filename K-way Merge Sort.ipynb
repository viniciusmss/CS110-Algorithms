    "    Implement three-way merge sort in Python. It should at a minimum accept lists of integers as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implement a second version of three-way merge sort that calls insertion sort when sublists are below a certain length (of your choice) rather than continuing the subdivision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (Optional challenge) Implement k-way merge sort, where the user specifies k. Develop and run experiments to support a hypothesis about the “best” value of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Analyze and compare the practical run times of regular merge sort, three-way merge sort, and the augmented merge sort from (2). Use the tools developed in class to run experiments. Your results should be presented in a table, along with an explanatory paragraph and any useful graphs or other charts. Part of your analysis should indicate whether or not there is a “best” variation.\n",

    "### Complexity of merge\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the nested for loops at the end of the merge procedure. The outer loop iterates over the keys in the input array, thus running $n$ times. The inner loop iterates over the relevant keys of the temporary subarrays. We have $k$ subarrays in a k-way merge sort; thus the loop will run $k$ times. Therefore, and given we can ignore the other operations as they will not be as expensive complexity-wise, the merge procedure is $\\Theta(k*n)$. If $k$ is a constant, such as 2 in the binary merge sort, the complexity is $\\Theta(n)$. However, in the special case in which we declare $k$ to be equal to $n$, our merge procedure is $\\Theta(n^2)$. This special case is similar to selection sort, where we continuously find the ith smallest element in the array and place it in the ith position. The difference here is that the selection sort is an in-place sorting, whereas in the merge procedure we create auxiliary arrays to help with the sorting (thus not needing to swap keys as in selection sort). In a general case where we do not know the value of $k$, our merge algorithm is $\\Omega(n)$ and $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity of mergeSort\n",
    "\n",
    "K-way merge sort divides the initial array to be sorted into $k$ subarrays, each one $k$ times smaller than the initial input. If we define $k$ as a constant much smaller than $n$, we saw above that the complexity of the merge procedure should be $\\Theta(n)$. Therefore, we arrive at the following recursive relation: $$T(n) = k*T(n/k) + \\Theta(n).$$ The easiest way to solve this relation is to apply the second case of the master theorem. We have $a = b = k$, therefore: $$n^{\\log_ba} = n^{\\log_kk} = n.$$ Because $f(n) = \\Theta(n) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_ba})$, we know from the master theorem that $T(n) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_ba}*\\log n) = \\Theta(n*\\log n)$. Therefore, for small $k$, we should not expect the running time complexity of merge sort to vary with $k$. It is possible, however, that the constants vary predictably such as to show a certain value of $k$ to be superior to others. A hypothetical cause could be that as we increase $k$, we decrease the recursive calls made to mergeSort. We increase, however, the complexity of the merge procedure as we need to perform k comparisons before finding the correct key. We will test these hypotheses experimentally further below."

    "The table presents running times in seconds. As expected, the running time increases log-linearly with input size for small $k$. We have evidence that as $k$ increases, the economy in recursive calls to mergeSort seems to outsize the added complexity of the merge procedure until $k$ gets close to the input size $n$. However, we also see some fluctuations in this pattern which prevents us from arriving at a definitive conclusion. The question of the relationship between an optimal choice of $k$ and the input size $n$ is a direction for further research. It is certain that, as we stipulated, that $k = n$ renders the merge procedure $O(n^2)$ thus being a poor choice. We have mixed evidence on whether including insertion sort as a resort for sorting small sublists improves the running of regular merge sort, leaving the benefit inconclusive. Therefore, the optimal k-way sorting algorithm seems to be one in which $2 < k << n$.\n",
